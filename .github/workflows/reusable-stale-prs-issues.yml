name: Reusable Stale PRs and Stale Issues

# This workflow analyzes pull requests and issues to identify and close stale ones that have not had any activity for
# a specified period. It will first add a stale label to the issue or PR, and if there is still no activity
# after a specified duration, it will close the issue or PR. It can also delete the branch if the PR is closed.
# It should be run on a nightly schedule. It's a thin wrapper with defaults set for https://github.com/actions/stale.
