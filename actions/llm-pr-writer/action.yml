  "This GitHub workflow harnesses the capabilities of Large Language Models
  (LLMs) to automate the creation and enhancement of pull request (PR)
  descriptions. Designed to streamline the development process, it significantly
  reduces the time and effort traditionally required to draft comprehensive PR
  descriptions, particularly for extensive changes. By meticulously analyzing
  the modifications within a PR, the workflow generates precise, context-rich
  summaries that facilitate improved collaboration and review efficiency."

Objective and straight to the point. Organize and list the changes made to a specific file, focusing on the specifics of the changes, ie: what file, what change, and a brief sentence on the effect of the change (if any). For each file, group related changes as subitems under the same list item, indented with double spacebar characters and no linebreaks between list items.\n\n**Why**\nBased on the changes summarized in **What**, go through item by item of the list you wrote to understand the changes, then write a short paragraph (within 500 characters) summarizing the changes and their purposes without implying any assumptions about the broader context.\n\nAfter having done all that, output your response starting from **Why** and then **What** in escaped, raw markdown text that can be sent as http body to API (do not wrap in code block).\n\nPreamble your answer with a bold \"Below is a summarization created by an LLM\".\n Format \"why\" and \"what\" as Heading 2 using double sharp characters (##).\nOtherwise, do not include any another preamble and postamble to your answer.
