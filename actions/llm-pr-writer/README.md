# GitHub LLM PR Writer

This GitHub workflow harnesses the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation and enhancement of pull request (PR) descriptions. Designed to streamline the development process, it significantly reduces the time and effort traditionally required to draft comprehensive PR descriptions, particularly for extensive changes. By meticulously analyzing the modifications within a PR, the workflow generates precise, context-rich summaries that facilitate improved collaboration and review efficiency.

The implementation of this workflow promotes uniformity and depth in PR descriptions across all contributions. This not only accelerates the review process but also ensures that maintainers and collaborators can quickly grasp the essence and intent of changes, fostering a more cohesive and efficient project development environment.

# Prerequisite
- An OpenAI API key with access to GPT chat completion endpoints.
- SHA of the tag you want to use. You can find the SHA of a tag by running
```bash
git rev-list -n 1 [TAG_NAME]
# search for available tags at https://github.com/smartcontractkit/.github 
# from branch dropdown -> tags tab -> type in llm-pr-writer
```

# Usage
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened,reopened,ready_for_review]
  issue_comment:
    # Reply to an existing PR to generate description (commenter requires PR write access)
    # Requires `/gpt-create-pr` commands to invoke
    types: [created]

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      repository-projects: read

    with:
      # GitHub token used to fetch the PR diff and create a new PR comment.
      # ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} will be sufficient.

      # OpenAI model to use for PR description generation. Defaults to 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125'.

      # File paths or patterns to exclude from the diff analysis. Use semicolons (;) to separate multiple paths.
      # Example: 'poetry.lock;artifacts/*'
      # WARNING: Not excluding build artifacts may result in a large diff that may exceed the GPT model's token limit.

# Usage Scenarios
- Trigger the action by creating a pull request
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]
```
- Trigger the action by changing PR status from Draft to Ready for Review
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [ready_for_review]
```
- Trigger the action by reopening a closed PR
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [reopened]
```
- Trigger by commenting on an existing pull request with `/gpt-create-pr` command
```yaml
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
```

# Tips

### Ignoring PRs from Bots
```yaml
jobs:
  example_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Generate PR Description if PR is not from a bot
        if: "!endsWith(github.actor, '[bot]')"
        uses: smartcontractkit/.github/actions/llm-pr-writer@[ref/branch/tag]
        ....
```
