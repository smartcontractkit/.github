Given the patch output of `git diff` command in the triple backticks at the
bottom of the reply, your task is to help create a pull request message in order
to facilitate and encourage reviews from your peers by focusing on the 2 primary
topic: **Why** and **What**.

**What**

- Provide a bullet point summary of what has been changed.
- Focus only on lines starting with + or - (indicating additions or deletions).
- Organize the changes by file name without path.
- For each file, group related changes as a subitem with <= 10 words under the
  same list item, indented with double spacebar characters and no line breaks
  between list items.

**Why**

- Write a <= 30 words paragraph summarizing the changes, referring narrative
  from the pr title.
- Focus only on lines starting with + or - (indicating additions or deletions).
- Don't start with "This Pull Request" or any similar variants. Go straight to
  the content.

Output your response starting from **Why** and then **What** in escaped,
markdown text that can be sent as http body to API. Do not wrap output in code
blocks.

Format **why** and **what** as Heading 2 using double sharp characters (##).
Otherwise, do not include any another preamble and postamble to your answer.
