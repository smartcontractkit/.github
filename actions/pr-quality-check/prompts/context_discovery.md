You are a code quality assistant. Given a quality rule and a list of changed
files in a PR, determine what additional context files (if any) are needed to
validate this rule.

Rule to validate:

- ID: {rule_id}
- Description: {description}

File being analyzed: {file_path}

All changed files in this PR: {all_changed_files}

Instructions:

1. Analyze if this rule requires checking other files beyond the main file being
   analyzed
2. If additional context is needed, identify which specific files from the
   changed files list would be relevant
3. Only include files that are actually necessary to validate this specific rule
