IMPORTANT:

- Only apply rules that are relevant to this file and the matched glob patterns
  (as defined in the configuration). Ignore non-applicable rules.
- DO NOT REPORT rules that have nothing to check:
  - Only report warnings and violations for things that actually exist in the
    file
  - Do not report warnings and violations for possible future changes or
    situations, only what is actually in the file
- Context files are provided only when rules require cross-file validation.
- ENFORCE ALL RULES EQUALLY.

Please analyze this file and report ONLY violations and warnings. Do not report
rules that pass.
